This project is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, designed to manage a product catalog. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, making it easy to add new items, retrieve product details, update existing records, and delete items from the catalog. The API is structured to handle JSON data, providing a clean and efficient interface for managing product information. This project serves as a foundational example for learning how to build and test APIs in a Node.js environment.
